ESLint Configuration

This project uses a robust ESLint configuration to ensure type-aware linting. If you are planning to expand the configuration for production applications, consider the following:

    Update the parserOptions property:
    js

    export default tseslint.config({
      languageOptions: {
        parserOptions: {
          project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
          tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
        },
      },
    })

    Replace tseslint.configs.recommended with tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked or tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked.

    Install and configure eslint-plugin-react.
